## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/martenzoe/book_alchemy.git
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your web browser to use the app.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can interact with the application via the following routes:
- **Home** (`/home`): View, search, and sort the list of books.
- **Add Author** (`/add_author`): Add a new author to the database.
- **Add Book** (`/add_book`): Add a new book and link it to an author (or assign it to "Unknown Author").
- **Delete Book** (`/book/<id>/delete`): Remove a book from the database.

The app is responsive and works on mobile devices as well.

## Database Setup

To set up the database, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that your `data_models.py` file contains the following models:

   ```python
   from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
   from sqlalchemy import Integer, String, Column, ForeignKey
   from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

   db = SQLAlchemy()

   class Author(db.Model):
       __tablename__ = "authors"
       author_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
       name = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Name cannot be null
       birth_date = Column(String)
       date_of_death = Column(String)
       
       # Relationship to Book
       books = relationship("Book", back_populates="author")

   class Book(db.Model):
       __tablename__ = "books"
       book_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
       author_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("authors.author_id"), nullable=False)
       isbn = Column(String)
       title = Column(String, nullable=False)  # Title cannot be null
       publication_year = Column(Integer)
       
       # Relationship to Author
       author = relationship("Author", back_populates="books")
   ```

2. In your `app.py`, ensure that you initialize the database and create tables:

   ```python
   with app.app_context():
       db.create_all()
   ```
Important!!! Only run this once for creating the tables, after first run please comment it out:   
with app.app_context():
       db.create_all()

3. Run the application once to create the tables in your SQLite database:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. The database will now contain two tables:
   - `authors`: Stores information about authors.
   - `books`: Stores information about books and links them to authors.

## Technologies

The following technologies are used in this project:

- **Flask**: Web framework for Python.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for interacting with the database.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storing authors and books.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend technologies for styling and layout.
- **Jinja2**: Template engine used by Flask.
